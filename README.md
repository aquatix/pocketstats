# pocketstats

Statistics of your [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) usage: how many are still unread, how many have you favourited, are deleted and are archived?

`pocketstats` keeps track of the metadata of your saved items through the [Pocket API](https://getpocket.com/developer/) and is intended to be run periodically through cron (for example, once per day).
